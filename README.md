Network Packet Analyzer
The Network Packet Analyzer is a C++ program for capturing and analyzing network packets in real-time. It uses libraries such as pcap and ncurses on Ubuntu to provide a comprehensive network analysis tool.

Features
Real-time capture and analysis of network packets
Efficient data structures and optimized code for high performance
Strong networking fundamentals and TCP/IP protocol understanding
Signal handling and real-time data display using ncurses
Build automation with cmake


Installation
Prerequisites:
Ubuntu Linux
CMake
libpcap
ncurses library


A good README for the "Network Packet Analyzer" project should provide enough information for someone to understand what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Here's a template you can use:
